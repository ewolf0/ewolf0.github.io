	<p>This collection includes 40 items of antique jewelry from the Art Deco period. They were all selected from the archive of an internationally renowned Toronto-based auction house. 
</p>

Aside from the rare poison ring or the infamous key necklace from Zoey 101, pieces of jewelry are arguably un-utilitarian. In choosing this collection I wanted to explore the value of things and how we determine that value vs. how those around us determine value. Additionally, I am intrigued by the emotional connection people form towards their jewelry, in particular how items are frequently viewed as “forever pieces”. Until they’re not -- which is where auction houses come in. The fun in these is that unless information was provided, you have no idea where your item came from and it is therefore far more unique than an item from a store. Maybe a woman got divorced and sold all the jewelry her ex husband gave her. Maybe it’s from the estate of a titled European lately who recently died. Maybe it’s from your next door neighbour.

In exploring this collection I wanted to further understand and better articulate my own connection to these pieces and why I find myself so drawn to jewelry in general -- to the point where I would one day like to earn a gemology certification and work in an auction house or with a jeweler. My fascination with these things is long rooted in my mom and her mom as well as a deep interest in rocks and minerals from an early age. In the past it has been that rings, or wearing many of them, were a sort of definitive feature of my personality. I was not “me” without them and they were me even without me. My position on this has changed slightly and it is interesting to note that, when “paring myself down”, the first thing to be removed or left out is the jewelry, specifically rings. Over the course of this project and frankly this semester I have come to wonder if this sporting of excessive jewelry has been a shield of some sort. Yes, I am in awe and incredibly appreciative of the craftsmanship that goes into each piece and it brings me constant joy to look at them, but I also wonder why. I wonder if wearing this beautiful things in turn makes me appear more beautiful. If I sport all of this because I feel that I lack something without them. I guess the answer to this question, at least now, is yes, no, and I don’t know.

This project has been very difficult and I suspect it is primarily because I have struggled to articulate why the collection is of great importance to me. This is something I continue to struggle with but I am no doubt on the right track to finding out exactly why this is.
