	<div id="about1">
		<p>Modern diamond mining essentially began with the discovery of diamond deposits within South Africa. It is thought that by 1900 the company De Beers was responsible for approximately 90% of the world’s diamonds. Diamond mining also began moving further underground which forced new and more efficient techniques to arise. Things such as reduction of costs, advances in processing, and improved marketing were all things that occurred after this shift. The annual production of rough diamonds was around 3 million around the 1920’s.
