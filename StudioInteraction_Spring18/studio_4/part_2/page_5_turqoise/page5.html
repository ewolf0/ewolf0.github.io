	<div id="about1">
		<p>Turquoise has been historically mined for hundreds of years. For a long time the most important and high-quality deposits existed in Persia. Around the start of the 1900â€™s, high quality turquoise deposits were discovered in the western US and there was a sort of shift in the supply chain. What was once referred to as Persian turquoise for being the best in quality from the best place now solely refers to the quality of the mineral rather than its geographic location.
